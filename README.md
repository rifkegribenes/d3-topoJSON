## Map Data Across the Globe (Freecodecamp Project)

### User stories:

* I can see where all Meteorites landed on a world map.
* I can tell the relative size of the meteorite, just by looking at the way it's represented on the map.
* I can mouse over the meteorite's data point for additional data.
